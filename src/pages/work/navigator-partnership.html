<p>
  The Navigator Partnership are a Glasgow based marketing services
  partner that “provides fantastic experiences for your audiences
  across web, digital and creative”. They required a website that
  showcased their services and methodology.
</p>
<p>
  Working with a design by Michelle Haswell, the result is a
  bright, bold WordPress site that is responsive and
  mobile-friendly.
</p>
<p>
  The site is built using WordPress and features a
  mobile-friendly, responsive design that adapts across mobile,
  tablet and desktop computers.
</p>
<p>
  The design looked great but was challenging to build as there
  feature several &#8216;off-grid' positioned element, which
  was especially difficult to achieve across different screen
  sizes.
