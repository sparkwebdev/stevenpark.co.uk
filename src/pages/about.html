<h3>About My Work</h3>

<p>I am primarily a front-end developer but have full-stack skills, along with some decent design chops. Most of my client sites are built using WordPress, but I use a <a href="/work/tools">wide range of tech</a> and I try my best to keep on top of the latest web tools and trends and incorporate them into my work.</p>

<p>Each web project I work on aims for a high level of <strong>standards-compliance, accessibility and browser performance</strong>. I always try to focus on the userâ€™s experience and keep in mind that a website should not only look great but work great too.</p>

<h3>My Values & Goalsâ€¦</h3>

When working with me you can expect me to aim high and stick to my values, values such as honesty, patience and advocating best practice where possible. The following principles are what guide me when working on any project:

  </li>

<h3>Giving Back</h3>

<p>This industry has given me a lot over the years â€”Â a wealth of knowledge, help, advice (usually freely given) and not least a roof over my head. I try to always be mindful of how lucky I was to stumble into the new-fangled Internet-thingy (after badly failing to get into art school), and so I try to give a little back with...</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Discounts for charities and non-profits</strong> â€”Â I offer a discount for registered charities, not-for-profits and companies/organisations offering support, education or community services and similar. This discount usually ranges from 10-20% but can be more â€”Â <a href="/contact">ask me for details</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Volunteering</strong> â€”Â I try to dedicate some time to helping charitable organisations. This has included volunteering for <a href="https://www.oxfam.org.uk/">Oxfam</a>, supporting student at <a href="https://codeyourfuture.io/">Code Your Future</a> and providing free web development services, such as for <a href="http://www.ecodrama.co.uk/">Eco Drama</a>.</p>
    <p><strong><em>I currently have capacity for some more work â€”Â <a href="/contact">please reach out</a> if you need help with your website.</em></strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Donating</strong> â€”Â in recent years I have donated a portion of profits to worthwhile causes. Previous recipients have been <a href="https://www.caat.org.uk/">Campaign Against Arms Trade</a>, <a href="https://tinychanges.com/">Tiny Changes</a> and <a href="https://colorofchange.org/">Color Of Change</a>.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Saying 'No'</h3>

<p>Sometimes it's important to say 'no' to work and I will never take work from the following sectors.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Any company that causes intentional or excessive harm to wildlife and/or the environment</li>
  <li>Tobacco, gambling and similarly exploitative industries</li>
  <li>The military, weapons suppliers and/or any company that facilitates in the violent suppression of free protest</li>
</ul>

<p>This is not a definitive list but a reflection of my priorities and belief that some things are more important than money.</p>
