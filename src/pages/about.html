title: About me
subtitle: I am a freelance web developer and designer based in Glasgow, Scotland.
---

<p>Iâ€™ve been working in the industry since the early 2000s ðŸ¤¯. From around 2009 I have been an independent freelancer, collaborating with like-minded folks and agencies, as well as directly with businesses, charities and public sector organisations.</p>

<p>I also take on longer term consultancy/contract work, if the project is right.</p>

<h3>About My Work</h3>

<p>I am primarily a front-end developer but have full-stack skills, along with some decent design chops. Most of my client sites are <em><strong>built using WordPress</strong></em>, but I use a <a href="/work/tools">wide range of tech</a>. I try my best to keep on top of the latest web tools and trends and incorporate them into my work.</p>

<p>Each web project I work on aims for a high level of <em><strong>standards-compliance, accessibility and browser performance</strong></em>. I always try to focus on the userâ€™s experience and keep in mind that a website should not only look great but work great too.</p>

<h3>My Values &amp; Goalsâ€¦</h3>

<p>When working with me you can expect me to aim high and stick to my values, values such as <em><strong>honesty, patience and advocating best practice</strong></em> where possible. The following principles are what guide me when working on any project:</p>

<ol class="[ feature-list ] auto-grid">
  <li>
    <strong class="[ feature-list__item-title ]">Be open, up-front and honest:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>No hidden costs or surprises</li>
      <li>No passing your work on to others</li>
      <li>No restricting access to your website</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong class="[ feature-list__item-title ]">Be reliable, patient and understanding:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>See through every project</li>
      <li>Take time to listen and support</li>
      <li>Stick around to offer on-going support</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong class="[ feature-list__item-title ]">Follow industry best practice:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Avoid taking shortcuts</li>
      <li>Do not exclude users based on ability</li>

      <li>Research latest trends &amp; technologies</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3>Giving Back</h3>

<p>This industry has given me a lot over the years â€”Â a wealth of knowledge, help, advice (usually freely given) and not least a roof over my head. I try to always be mindful of how lucky I was to stumble into the new-fangled Internet-thingy (after failing to get into art school), and so I try to give a little back with...</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Discounts for charities and non-profits</strong> â€”Â I offer a discount for registered charities, not-for-profits and companies/organisations offering support, education or community services and similar. This discount usually ranges from 10-20% but can be more â€”Â <a href="/contact">ask me for details</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Donating</strong> â€”Â in recent years I have donated a portion of profits to worthwhile causes. Previous recipients have been <a href="https://www.caat.org.uk/">Campaign Against Arms Trade</a>, <a href="https://tinychanges.com/">Tiny Changes</a> and <a href="https://colorofchange.org/">Color Of Change</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Volunteering</strong> â€”Â I try to dedicate some free time each month to helping charitable organisations. 
    {# This has included volunteering for <a href="https://www.oxfam.org.uk/">Oxfam</a>, supporting student at <a href="https://codeyourfuture.io/">Code Your Future</a> and providing free web development services, such as for <a href="http://www.ecodrama.co.uk/">Eco Drama</a>.</p> #}
    <em><strong>I currently have capacity for some more work</strong></em> â€”Â <a href="/contact">please reach out</a> if you need help with your website.</p>

</ul>

<h3>Saying 'No'</h3>

<p>Sometimes it's important to say 'no' to work and I will never take work from the following sectors.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Any company that causes intentional or excessive harm to wildlife and/or the environment</li>
  <li>Tobacco, gambling and similarly exploitative industries</li>
  <li>The military, weapons suppliers and/or any company that facilitates in the violent suppression of free protest</li>
</ul>

<p>This is not a definitive list but more a reflection of my priorities and belief that some things are more important than money.</p>
