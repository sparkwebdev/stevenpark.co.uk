  <p>Steven and I have worked together on numerous projects within the arts sector. Always a pleasure to work with, he is <strong><em>receptive to ideas, reliable and committed</em></strong> to creating a high quality and design focussed finished product. The Forth Valley Open Studios iOS app and responsively designed website both are great products which I am very pleased with.</p>

  <p>I liked Steven's friendly and clear approach and I knew where I stood with him from the first point of contact. I really liked his 'to-do' tracker and felt informed at all stages. <strong><em>He met all deadlines</em></strong> specified which was very reassuring. He also ensured everything was covered, made necessary changes, and checked in if anything wasn't right, and this care ensured we were really happy with the finished website.</p>
  <p>I found on a couple of occasions during the meetings that some information about the site was a little hard to understand from a non web designer point of view, but nevertheless, did help get my head around things better.</p>
  <p>Good mannered, pleasant to work with and a very quick worker - we are <strong><em>really happy with our website and we would definitely recommend Steven</em></strong> to other people or companies in future.</p>
