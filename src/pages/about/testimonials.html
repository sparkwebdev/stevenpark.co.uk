  <p>I liked Steven's friendly and clear approach and I knew where I stood with him from the first point of contact. I really liked his 'to-do' tracker and felt informed at all stages. He met all deadlines specified which was very reassuring. He also ensured everything was covered, made necessary changes, and checked in if anything wasn't right, and this care ensured we were really happy with the finished website.</p>
  <p>I found on a couple of occasions during the meetings that some information about the site was a little hard to understand from a non web designer point of view, but nevertheless, did help get my head around things better.</p>
  <p>Good mannered, pleasant to work with and a very quick worker - we are really happy with our website and we would definitely recommend Steven to other people or companies in future.</p>

  <p>We've been very impressed with your customer service - we always get friendly, prompt replies to our (endless) questions - and the fliers and poster you designed for us are fabulous. We asked you to create a look that was professional and also fitted our ethos of working with community projects...and you did! In fact, your work has been so good that we've had to ask you to finish building our website for us as well. Compared to your designs our website looked a bit drab, and the designer we were using wasn't anywhere near as helpful.</p>
