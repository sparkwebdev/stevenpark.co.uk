    </dd>
  <dt>Do you offer ongoing support?</dt>

      <p>Yes, regular ongoing support can be purchased at reduced rates — please see my <a href="/about/prices-payment-terms/#support">example prices</a> and <a href="/contact/">get in touch</a> to discuss.</p>
    </dd>
  <dt>What tools/technologies do you use?</dt>
    <dd>

    </dd>
  <dt>What is your response time?</dt>
    <dd><p>For all support requests, I aim for a response time of 24-48 hours, although it is often same day.</p></dd>
  <dt>Can I host my WordPress site on my own servers or with another hosting company?</dt>
    <dd>
      <p>Yes, once your website is finished you are free to host it anywhere you like. Some companies will insist you use them for hosting and effectively 'lock you out' of accessing your site — I'll never do this!</p>
    </dd>
  <dt>Do you offer hosting or email services?</dt>
    <dd>
      <p>Not usually, no — I will work with you to source some reliable hosting and I'll be on hand to help you get your website live.</p>
    </dd>
  <dt>Can you recommend any hosting providers?</dt>
    <dd>
      <p>Sure, for WordPress, try these ones:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://getflywheel.com/">Flywheel</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://kinsta.com/">Kinsta</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://wpengine.co.uk/">WP Engine</a></li>
      </ul>
      <p>I always recommend paying a bit more decent hosting that is reliable and fast — the above should do the job.</p>
