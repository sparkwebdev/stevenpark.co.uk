## Articles

 ***Dave Rupert*** discusses browser diversity (post Mozilla layoffs) and the increasing complexity of modern web dev,  ***Sophie Hodge*** compares the behaviour of our users to cats ðŸ™€,  ***Christian Heilmann*** encourages us to ensure (dev) tools are built to be inclusive and  ***Built for Mars*** disects 'buy-now, pay-later' payment system Klarna, used by the likes of ASOS. Also,  ***Davor TvoriÄ‡*** documents his React mastery journey... although  ***Ender Minyard*** and  ***Jim Nielsen*** both warn against 'expensive' front-end frameworks, whilst  ***Lea Verou*** looks for some stricter criteria around web components.

## Techniques & Tutorials

Accessibility specialist ***Manuel Matuzovic***  talks accessible CSS, ***Patrick Brosset***  highlights how CSS custom properties behave in the browser. ***Val Head*** describes accessible web animation and ***LÃ©onie Watson***  takes on the tricky subject of how screen readers navigate data tables. ***Ender Minyard*** and ***Chris Bongers***  give web performance tips and there's a couple of conferences, one past (Inclusive Design 24) and one upcoming (Jamstack Conf Virtual).

## Design and Ethics

***Chris Coyier*** discusses the important, not-mentioned-enough topic of website carbon emissions, ***Aleksandr Hovhannisyan*** picks up on those over-used (albeit it lovely) "happy blue people" illustrations. I watched and enjoyed ***Netflix***'s documentary-drama 'The Social Dilemma' but some there's some well-founded criticism from ***Pranav Malhotra*** and ***Brandon Dorn*** dissect the web brutalism design aesthetic.

## Tools

Parse Hub is an open-source web scraping tool I used recently, ***Duet Design System*** recently released "yet another" date picker but very welcome it is, as it's a tricky thing to do well (as I've found to my cost...) and has a focus on accessibility. There's more accessibility tools from ***a11yresources***, the ***Cory LaViska***'s Shoelace web component library gets an update, ***Pablo Stanley*** gives us a lovely collection of diverse, customisable hand-drawn people illustrations (now with added face masks! ðŸ˜·) and lastly an open source modular components library from ***Chromatic***.
