                across web, digital and creative”. They required a website that
                showcased their services and methodology.
              </p>

                The site is built using WordPress and features a
                mobile-friendly, responsive design that adapts across mobile,
                tablet and desktop computers.

                The design looked great but was challenging to build as there
                feature several &#8216;off-grid&#8217; positioned element, which
                was especially difficult to achieve across different screen
                sizes.
