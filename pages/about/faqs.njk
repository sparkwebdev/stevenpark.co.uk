          <dt>Q. Do you offer hosting?</dt>
          <dd>
            <p>
              Yes, please browse
              <a
                href="http://stevenpark.co.uk/about/prices-payment-terms/#hosting"
                >available hosting options</a
              >. My hosting prices, although not the cheapest, are competitive
              and offer more tailored and secure features than you get with some
              cheaper hosts.
            </p>
            <p>
              However, if you're budget is tight and/or you don't require all
              the features of my hosting, here are a couple of my recommended
              third-party WordPress compatible hosting and domain providers:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>

                  >Siteground</a
                >
                (approx. £8 to £14 a month) — Wordpress hosting with lots of
                features
              </li>
              <li>
                <a
                  href="https://www.zen.co.uk/smallerbusiness/hosting-and-domains/hosting/"
                  target="_blank"
                  >Zen Hosting</a
                >
                (approx. £5 to £10 a month) — cheap but reliable, UK based
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              &hellip;and I can be on hand to help you get your website on one
              of the above hosts.

          <dt>
            Q. Can I host my WordPress site on my own servers or with another
            hosting company?
          </dt>
          <dd>
            <p>
              Yes, once your website is finished you are free to host it
              anywhere you like. Some companies will insist you use them for
              hosting and effectively 'lock you out' of accessing your site —
              I'll never do this!
