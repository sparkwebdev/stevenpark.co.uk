<ul>
  <li>
    A deposit is required to be paid before commencement of work,
    followed by interim payment(s) at appropriate stages throughout
    the project.
  </li>
  <li>
    The exact terms will be finalised and agreed by both parties
    before commencement of work and a contract will be required
    outlining these agreed terms.

    Only once full payment is received will your site be transferred
    to your ownership (e.g. transferred to the live server).

    Included within the standard terms and conditions are 14 days of
    free technical support after your site goes live to ensure that
    that every target that was set out in the project brief has been
    met.
  </li>
  <li>
    If you require to make any changes or updates after the 14 day
    support period, additional development time is available at my
    standard daily rate. Reduced rates are available for long-term
    commitments. <a href="#support">See below</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
    You may terminate the project at anytime but you will be
    required to pay for the work already carried out up to the point
    of termination.
  </li>
  <li>
    Monthly ongoing support requires payment each month before work
    commences. There is no minimum term and you may cancel at any
    time.

    By agreeing to proceed with any project it is understood that
    you are committing to the above terms.
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Do you need ongoing support?</h4>
<p>
  Absolutely not! A lot of the things I do, you can do, such as
  site backups, plugin updates and content changes. I'll
  show you how if you don't already know.
</p>
<p>
  But if you don't see yourself doing the above it is
  recommended you do purchase some ongoing support so that your
  site remains secure and up-to-date.

<h4>Looking for something cheaper?</h4>
<p>
  You don't have to host with myself — I'm a little
  more hands-on when it comes to hosting your site but I'm
  not the cheapest. If you are on a budget I can find you a
  cheaper 3rd party hosting provider, starting from about £100 per
  year… and I can be on hand to help you get your website online.
</p>
          
<h3 id="examples">Example Prices</h3>
<p>
  It is advised that you consider your requirements and define a
  rough budget before enquiring about prices. That way I can work to
  accommodate your requirements within your budget. However, if you
  would like an idea of costs, below gives a rough guide of what you
  can expect to pay.
