Bender, being God isn't easy. If you do too much, people get dependent on you, and if you do nothing, they lose hope. You have to use a light touch. Like a safecracker, or a pickpocket. The key to victory is discipline, and that means a well made bed. You will practice until you can make your bed in your sleep.

## I found what I need. And it's not friends, it's things.

That's right, baby. I ain't your loverboy Flexo, the guy you love so much. You even love anyone pretending to be him! Oh God, what have I done? I love this planet! I've got wealth, fame, and access to the depths of sleaze that those things bring.

In your time, yes, but nowadays shut up! Besides, these are adult stemcells, harvested from perfectly healthy adults whom I killed for their stemcells.
We need rest. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is spongy and bruised.

Perhaps, but perhaps your civilization is merely the sewer of an even greater society above you!

``` js/2/4
// this is a command
function myCommand() {
	let counter = 0;

	counter++;

}

// Test with a line break above this line.
console.log('Test');
```

These old Doomsday Devices are dangerously unstable. I'll rest easier not knowing where they are. Professor, make a woman out of me. A sexy mistake. You can crush me but you can't crush my spirit! Shut up and take my money!


### You guys realize you live in a sewer, right?

I was having the most wonderful dream. Except you were there, and you were there, and you were there! Then we'll go with that data file! Is that a cooking show? I feel like I was mauled by Jesus.  I meant 'physically'. Look, perhaps you could let me work for a little food? I could clean the floors or paint a fence, or service you sexually? Hey! I'm a porno-dealing monster, what do I care what you think?

Wow, you got that off the Internet? In my day, the Internet was only used to download pornography. What are their names? And yet you haven't said what I told you to say! How can any of us trust you? Yes, I saw. You were doing well, until everyone died.

Oh, but you can. But you may have to metaphorically make a deal with the devil. And by "devil", I mean Robot Devil. And by "metaphorically", I mean get your coat. For example, if you killed your grandfather, you'd cease to exist!

When will that be? A true inspiration for the children. Kif might! Hey, whatcha watching? You guys realize you live in a sewer, right? It may comfort you to know that Fry's death took only fifteen seconds, yet the pain was so intense, that it felt to him like fifteen years. And it goes without saying, it caused him to empty his bowels.

Who am I making this out to? I love you, buddy! That's not soon enough! I don't know what you did, Fry, but once again, you screwed up! Now all the planets are gonna start cracking wise about our mamas.

A true inspiration for the children. Yeah, and if you were the pope they'd be all, "Straighten your pope hat." And "Put on your good vestments." I videotape every customer that comes in here, so that I may blackmail them later.
