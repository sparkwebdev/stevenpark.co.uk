          <h1>About</h1>
          <p>
            I am a freelance web developer and designer based in Glasgow,
            Scotland and I&#8217;ve been in the industry in various forms for
            over 10 years.

        <p>
          After graduating in Multimedia Technology I worked for public and
          private sector organisations, starting out at a well-known national
          publishing company, then moving on to a large education organisation,
          working on their high-profile web portal for over 4 years. Since
          around 2009 I have been working as a freelancer, collaborating with
          like-minded folks and agencies, as well as directly with businesses,
          charities and public sector organisations.

        <h2>About My Work</h2>
        <p>
          The work I do is generally split into two areas: One, working directly
          with small to medium sized businesses and organisations, designing and
          building websites and apps. Two, working with various partners across
          Glasgow and Edinburgh to collaborate on web projects, including
          digital agencies and talented freelancers. This allows me to provide a
          wide range of design, development and consultancy services, whilst
          still giving a personalised service.

          I am a full-stack developer, with an emphasis on front-end
          development. Each web project I work on aims for a high level of
          standards-compliance, performance and search engine optimisation. I
          always try to focus on the user&#8217;s experience and keep in mind
          that a website should not only look great but work great too. Although
          most of my sites are built using WordPress, I use a wide range of
          tools and I try my best to keep on top of the latest web technologies
          and incorporate them into my work.

        <h3>My Values &#038; Goalsâ€¦</h3>
        <p>
          When working with me you can expect me to aim high and stick to my
          values, values such as honesty, patience and advocating best practice
          where possible. The following principles are what guide me when
          working on any project:
