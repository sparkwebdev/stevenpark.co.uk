<p>I am a freelance web developer and designer based in Glasgow, Scotland and I've been in the industry in various forms for over 10 years.</p>

<p>After graduating in Multimedia Technology I worked for public and private sector organisations, starting out at a well-known national publishing company, then moving on to a large education organisation, working on their high-profile web portal for over 4 years. Since around 2009 I have been working as a freelancer, collaborating with like-minded folks and agencies, as well as directly with businesses, charities and public sector organisations.</p>

<h2>About My Work</h2>

<p>The work I do is generally split into two areas: One, working directly with small to medium sized businesses and organisations, designing and building websites and apps. Two, working with various partners across Glasgow and Edinburgh to collaborate on web projects, including digital agencies and talented freelancers. This allows me to provide a wide range of design, development and consultancy services, whilst still giving a personalised service.</p>

<p>I am a full-stack developer, with an emphasis on front-end development. Each web project I work on aims for a high level of standards-compliance, performance and search engine optimisation. I always try to focus on the user's experience and keep in mind that a website should not only look great but work great too. Although most of my sites are built using WordPress, I use a wide range of tools and I try my best to keep on top of the latest web technologies and incorporate them into my work.</p>

<h3>My Values &#038; Goalsâ€¦</h3>

<p>When working with me you can expect me to aim high and stick to my values, values such as honesty, patience and advocating best practice where possible. The following principles are what guide me when working on any project:</p>
